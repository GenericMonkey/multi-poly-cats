* Cubical formalization of Basic Categorical Type Theory

Trying out cubical agda formalizations of different approaches to
categorical semantics of type theories.

** Cubical Version

This development heavily relies on some extensions to the cubical agda
stdlib that covers representability of presheaves which are under
`Cubical/`. I expect these to be merged upstream eventually.
